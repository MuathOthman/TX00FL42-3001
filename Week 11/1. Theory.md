# Using external interfaces

In this module you will learn to use external Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).

Providers of public Internet services such as weather services and open databases make it possible
to use their publicly available resources in programs. The resources are accessed through an API.
The provider of a service decided the type of API it offers and how it is used. Using an API requires
for a programmer to become familiar with the documentation of the API.


## Data transfer in Internet

Let us first examine what happens when computers connected to the Internet communicate with each other.
This provides us the foundations for understanding and implementing cross-device communication.

Data communication in the Internet is based on client-server model. A computer that is connected
to the Internet, waiting for other computers to connect to it, is called a server.
In practice, a computer
becomes a server when in runs a dedicated server application that instructs the computer to wait for upcoming connections.

Informally, when we talk about servers, we may mean:

- a computer connected to the Internet that acts as a server, or
- a server application that runs in a server computer.

In accordance with the client-server model, the computer that initiates a connection to the server machine (and the
server application therein) first sends a request. The server handles the request and provides a response:

![Client server model](img/client-server.png)

The retrieval of web pages follows the client-server model. As you write a web address into the browser's address
bar (or click a link on a web page), a request is sent to the web server. The web server then sends an HTML file
describing the web page as a response. If the web page requires additional resources (such as images or stylesheets),
new requests are generated, and the requested resources are received as responses.

In a similar fashion to web pages, we can also retrieve any data from an external server. For example, we can write a Python program that retrieves
todays weather data, or (as we will soon do), information about a TV show selected by the user. In this case, our
own Python client sends a request to the external server, and receives a response.

The service providers (such as the weather service or the TV show search service) provide so-called APIs, or application
programming interfaces. The documentation of an interface specifies what kind of requests it understands, and what the
format for the response will be.

## Sending requests

API requests follow the HTTP protocol. HTTP is an agreement on how the requests are sent and what the overall shape of the responses will be.
Speaking figuratively, HTTP defines the envelope which the requests are slipped into so that they can be sent via
the Internet. Likewise, it specifies the overall structure of the response: for example, HTTP defines each response
to contain both a header part and a body part. Moreover, a status code is sent with each response to provide
information on the success or failure of the request.

The HTTP protocol defines five general operations (or resource methods):

- GET retrieves/reads a data object
- PUT replaces an existing data object
- POST creates a new data object
- PATCH modifies an existing data object
- DELETE deletes an existing data object

The GET operation is the same operation that is used for regular web page requests. If an interface is designed
to follow the so called REST API design practices, all five operations listed here can be used. The RESTful design
specification also follows other design principles that are not discussed here.

The specification of an effective API can also be based on only the GET operation, but in that case, it is
not considered a true REST API. On this course we will explore the use and implementation of an API that is based on
the GET operation.

As an example, let's look at how to use the API provided by the TVmaze service. The API documentation can be found here:
https://www.tvmaze.com/api.

TVmaze offers a public open API that does not require a user account to use. These types of APIs usually only allow
read operations. Read operations are performed with GET requests.

Our goal is to write a Python program that fetches all TV programs that include a string of text written by the user.
Based on the documentation of the TVmaze API this type of an API request should be given in the format of
`URL: /search/shows?q=:query` and an example of such request would be https://api.tvmaze.com/search/shows?q=girls.

The operation of the request should first be tested by writing the request statement to the address bar of a web browser
(such as Chrome). Typically, it is only possible to send GET requests via a browser.

From a Python program a similar request is sent using the `get` method from the `requests` library. Notice: You need to install the `requests` library in PyCharm.
Applying the `json` method to the received response converts the data to a Python dictionary structure:

```python
import requests

keyword = input("Enter keyword: ")

# Request template: https://api.tvmaze.com/search/shows?q=girls
request = "https://api.tvmaze.com/search/shows?q=" + keyword
response = requests.get(request).json()
print(response)
```

Let's see how the program works:
```monospace
Enter keyword: python

```

The request was sent successfully, and a response is received.
The API sends the response in JSON format that can be converted into a Python dictionary by using
the `json` method inherited by the response object. (JSON is a format commonly used in transferring structured data.
It follows the object structure of the JavaScript programming language. Conceptually, a JSON structure
is very similar to a Python dictionary.)

The resulting dictionary structure must still be examined and processed so
that we can print out the information we want.

### Did you get an error instead of the JSON?

Make sure to install the `requests` library in PyCharm. Easiest way to install is to move your mouse cursor on top of the `import requests` statement, and click on the `Install package requests` button in the tooltip, as shown in the screenshot below.

<img width="826" alt="Screenshot 2024-10-23 at 11 23 28" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/061654ce-4b1c-49a5-af1a-4c724297c0fd">



## Processing the response

Above the dictionary structure obtained from the JSON response was stored in a variable called `response`. A function called `json.dumps` can
be used to clarify the structure of the response data. It modifies the structure of the response so that
it is easier to read. Let's replace the printing statement with:

```python
print(json.dumps(response, indent=2))
```

For this, we must add an `import` statement to the start of the program:
```python
import json
```

Now the structure of the response is easier to understand. This is what the start of the response looks like:

```json
[
  {
    "score": 0.6097852,
    "show": {
      "id": 25376,
      "url": "https://www.tvmaze.com/shows/25376/python-hunters",
      "name": "Python Hunters",
      "type": "Reality",
      "language": "English",
      "genres": [
        "Nature"
      ],
```

Here we see that the items in the resulting list are programs and each of the programs are presented
as a dictionary structure. Each dictionary has the key `show` where the corresponding value is another
dictionary. The inner dictionary has the key `name` where the value contains a string of the name of the
TV program. As an example, the name of the first item on the `response` list could be referenced with the
expression `response[0][show][name]`.

Now we can replace the printing statement in the program with a `for` loop that prints out the name of each
of the found programs.

```python
for a in response:
    print(a["show"]["name"])
```

The start of the output looks as follows:

```monospace
Python Hunters
Monty Python: Almost the Truth
Mytho
Monty Python's Flying Circus
```

## Error handling

The above program that uses an external API only works when the external service (in this case TV Maze) is operational
an manages to execute the request it receives. As we are dealing with an external service, we cannot trust that the
service always works. Let's extend our program by adding necessary error checks so that we can program errors to be handled
in the way we want.

Error handling here is based on two factors:
1. The HTTP status code received with the response
2. Handling on exceptions that occur in the Python program

When the external service is operational, it returns an HTTP status code with the response. The status code is 200
when the request is successfully fulfilled. A failed request is responded with a status code that best describes
the error that occured. The official list of HTTP response status codes can be found on the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
web page at: https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html. The status code can be read in the program from the
`status_code` property returned by the `request.get` method. Here we will limit the error testing by only checking whether the
status code is 200 or something else.

Sometimes there can be a situation where the external service cannot be reached at all and as a result cannot even
return a status code that would show an error. This manifests as the Python program crashing during runtime, running to a so called
runtime error. In Python it is possible to program the exception handling yourself leaving it for the programmer to decide what
should happen when an exception occurs. Exception handling is done using a `try/except` structure.

Let's extend the program by adding a check for HTTP status code 200 and an exception handling routine for any exceptions raised by the `request` library.

Each Python exception is an object. Especially exceptions raised by the `requests` library are instances from classes derived from the `RequestException`
base class. With added error handling the program now looks like this:

```python
import json
import requests

keyword = input("Enter keyword: ")

# Request template: https://api.tvmaze.com/search/shows?q=girls
request = "https://api.tvmaze.com/search/shows?q=" + keyword

try:
    response = requests.get(request)
    if response.status_code==200:
        json_response = response.json()
        # print(json.dumps(json_response, indent=2))
        for a in json_response:
            print(a["show"]["name"])
except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
    print ("Request could not be completed.")
```

Let's see what happens when a request fails. We will change the request on purpose by adding a typo
in the URL. The domain code is now `cob` instead of `com`, which should produce an error:

```python
request = "https://api.tvmaze.cob/search/shows?q=" + keyword
```
Now the program does not crash when an error occurs, but works as we have programmed it do:
```monospace
Enter keyword: python
Request could not be completed.
```

In the end we of course fix the URL. Because of exception handling we are now prepared for
situation where TV Maze would for example be out of use due to a maintenance break. Programming
best practices include adding this type of error handling into programs.
