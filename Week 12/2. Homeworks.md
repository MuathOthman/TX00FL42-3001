## 12. Setting up a backend service with an interface

### 1. Prime Number Service
Implement a Flask backend service that tells whether a number received as a parameter is a prime number or not. Use the prior prime number exercise as a starting point. For example, a GET request for number 31 is given as: `http://127.0.0.1:5000/prime_number/31`. The response must be in the format:

```json
{
  "Number": 31,
  "isPrime": true
}
```

### 2. Airport Information Service (Excel-based)
Implement a backend service that reads airport information from an Excel file and provides the name and location of an airport based on its ICAO code. For example, the GET request for EFHK would be: `http://127.0.0.1:5000/airport/EFHK`. The response must be in the format:

```json
{
  "ICAO": "EFHK",
  "Name": "Helsinki-Vantaa Airport",
  "Location": "Helsinki"
}
```
The Excel file containing airport information can be [downloaded here](./airports.xlsx).
