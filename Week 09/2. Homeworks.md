## 9. Association

1. Write an `Elevator` class that receives the numbers of the bottom and top floors as initializer parameters. The elevator has methods `go_to_floor`,
   `floor_up` and `floor_down`. A new elevator is always at the bottom floor. If you make elevator `h` for example the method call `h.go_to_floor(5)`, the
   method calls either the `floor_up` or `floor_down` methods as many times as it needs to get to the fifth floor. The methods run the elevator
   one floor up or down and tell what floor the elevator is after each move. Test the class by creating an elevator in the main program, tell it to move
   to a floor of your choice and then back to the bottom floor.

2. Extend the previous program by creating a `Building` class. The initializer parameters for the class are the numbers of the bottom and top floors and
   the number of elevators in the building. When a building is created, the building creates the required number of elevators. The list of elevators is
   stored as a property of the building. Write a method called `run_elevator` that accepts the number of the elevator and the destination floor as its
   parameters. In the main program, write the statements for creating a new building and running the elevators of the building.

3. Extend the program again by adding a method `fire_alarm` that does not receive any parameters and moves all elevators to the bottom floor. Continue
   the main program by causing a fire alarm in your building.
