## 10. Inheritance

1. Implement the following class hierarchy using Python: A publication can be either a book or a magazine. Each publication has a name. Each book
   also has an author and a page count, whereas each magazine has a chief editor. Also write the required initializers to both classes. Create a
   `print_information` method to both subclasses for printing out all information of the publication in question. In the main program, create
   publications Donald Duck (chief editor Aki Hyypp√§) and Compartment No. 6 (author Rosa Liksom, 192 pages). Print out all information of both
   publications using the methods you implemented.

2. Extend the previosly written `Car` class by adding two subclasses: `ElectricCar` and `GasolineCar`. Electric cars have the capacity of the
   battery in kilowatt-hours as their property. Gasoline cars have the volume of the tank in liters as their property. Write initializers for the
   subclasses. For example, the initializer of electric cars receives the registration number, maximum speed and battery capacity as its parameter.
   It calls the initializer of the base class to set the first two properties and then sets its capacity. Write a main program where you create
   one electric car (ABC-15, 180 km/h, 52.5 kWh) and one gasoline car (ACD-123, 165 km/h, 32.3 l). Select speeds for both cars, make them drive for
   three hours and print out the values of their kilometer counters.
