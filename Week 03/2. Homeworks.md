## 3. Conditional Structures (if Statements)

### 1. Zander Fishing Length Checker
Write a program that prompts a fisher for the length of a zander in centimeters. If the zander is below the legal size limit, the program should instruct the fisher to release it back into the lake and tell them how many centimeters short the fish is of the limit. A zander must be at least **42 centimeters** long to be kept.

### 2. Cruise Ship Cabin Class Description
Create a program that asks the user to input the cabin class on a cruise ship and prints the corresponding description based on the following list:
   - **LUX**: Upper-deck cabin with a balcony.
   - **A**: Cabin above the car deck with a window.
   - **B**: Windowless cabin above the car deck.
   - **C**: Windowless cabin below the car deck.

You must use an **if**/**elif**/**else** structure in your solution. If the user inputs an invalid class, the program should output: `Invalid cabin class`.

### 3. Hemoglobin Level Checker
Design a program that asks the user for their biological gender and hemoglobin level (g/L). Based on the provided values, the program should inform the user if their hemoglobin is low, normal, or high. The normal ranges are:
   - For adult females: **117-155 g/L**.
   - For adult males: **134-167 g/L**.

### 4. Leap Year Checker
Write a program that asks the user to enter a year and tells them whether the year is a leap year. A year is a leap year if:
   - It is divisible by 4, **and** 
   - If divisible by 100, it must also be divisible by 400.
