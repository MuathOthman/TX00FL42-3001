## 7. Tuple, Set, and Dictionary Exercises

### 1. **Seasons Finder**

Write a program that asks the user for the number of a month and prints the corresponding season: `spring`, `summer`, `autumn`, or `winter`. The seasons are stored in a tuple, and we can define each season to last for three months, with December being the first month of winter.

#### Example:

- Input: `12` (December)
- Output: `Winter`

### 2. **Unique Names Collector**

Create a program where the user can enter names continuously until they input an empty string. After each entry, the program should either display `New name` or `Existing name` based on whether the name has already been entered. Finally, the program will output all unique names, one per line, in any order. Use a set to store the names.

#### Example:

- Input: `John`
- Output: `New name`
- Input: `Jane`
- Output: `New name`
- Input: `John`
- Output: `Existing name`

**Final Output:**
```
John
Jane
```

### 3. **Airport Information System**

Develop a program to fetch and store airport data. The program will offer three options:

1. Enter a new airport.
2. Fetch information of an existing airport.
3. Quit the program.

When entering a new airport, the program will prompt the user for the ICAO code and the airport name. When fetching information, the program will ask for the ICAO code and return the corresponding airport name. The program will continue running until the user chooses to quit. Use a dictionary where the ICAO code is the key and the airport name is the value.

#### Example:

- Input: `1` (Enter a new airport)
- Input: `EFHK`, `Helsinki-Vantaa Airport`
- Output: `Airport saved!`

- Input: `2` (Fetch existing airport)
- Input: `EFHK`
- Output: `Helsinki-Vantaa Airport`

- Input: `3` (Quit)
- Output: `Goodbye!`

#### Notes:
- The **ICAO code** is a unique identifier for airports (e.g., Helsinki-Vantaa Airport's ICAO code is `EFHK`).
