## 4. While loops (while)

### 1. Print Numbers Divisible by Three
Create a program using a `while` loop that prints all numbers divisible by three within the range of 1 to 1000.

### 2. Convert Inches to Centimeters Until Negative Input
Design a program that continuously converts inches to centimeters, stopping only when the user enters a negative value.

### 3. Find the Smallest and Largest Number from User Input
Write a program that prompts the user to enter numbers until they leave the input blank. Once the input stops, the program outputs the smallest and largest numbers entered.

### 4. Number Guessing Game with Feedback
Develop a game where the computer picks a random number between 1 and 10, and the user attempts to guess it. After each guess, the program provides feedback: `Too high`, `Too low`, or `Correct`. The number remains the same throughout the game until the user guesses correctly.
