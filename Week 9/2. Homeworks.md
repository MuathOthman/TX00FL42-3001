## 8. Fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming

### 1. Creating the `Car` Class

Write a `Car` class with the following properties:
- `registration_number`: Unique identifier for the car.
- `maximum_speed`: The maximum speed the car can reach.
- `current_speed`: The current speed of the car (initially set to 0).
- `travelled_distance`: The distance traveled by the car (initially set to 0).

Add an initializer (`__init__` method) to set the `registration_number` and `maximum_speed` properties. The `current_speed` and `travelled_distance` properties should be automatically set to 0 for every new car.

**Main Program:**
1. Create a new `Car` object with:
    - `registration_number = "ABC-123"`
    - `maximum_speed = 142 km/h`
2. Print out all the properties of the new car.

### 2. Adding the `accelerate` Method

Extend the `Car` class by adding an `accelerate` method with the following functionality:
- The `accelerate` method should receive `change_of_speed` (km/h) as a parameter.
    - If `change_of_speed` is positive, the car increases its speed.
    - If `change_of_speed` is negative, the car decreases its speed.
- The `current_speed` property should be updated accordingly, but must:
    - Not exceed the `maximum_speed`.
    - Not fall below 0.

**Main Program Extension:**
1. Accelerate the car in the following steps:
    - Increase speed by +30 km/h.
    - Increase speed by +70 km/h.
    - Increase speed by +50 km/h.
2. Print out the current speed.
3. Use an "emergency brake" by applying a speed change of -200 km/h.
4. Print out the final speed.

*Note:* The `travelled_distance` property does not need to be updated at this step.

### 3. Adding the `drive` Method

Add a `drive` method to the `Car` class with the following functionality:
- The `drive` method should receive `hours` as a parameter.
- The method should increase the `travelled_distance` by the amount the car travels at `current_speed` over the given time.

**Example Usage:**
1. Suppose the `car` object has:
    - `travelled_distance = 2000 km`
    - `current_speed = 60 km/h`
2. Calling `car.drive(1.5)` should increase `travelled_distance` to 2090 km (i.e., 2000 + 60 * 1.5).
